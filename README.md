# This game is an attempt to create a decent clone of the Starwhal game by Breakfall (www.starwhal.com).
# I'm choosing this game because it's quite fun to play and has cool physics involved in the gameplay, but it also seems relatively simplistic, so it's perfect for an early project to learn more about making games in Unity.
# Not much is done so far, and I haven't added any code yet, but I'll add a ton in the next few days. I just wanted to get this started since I just had the idea, and so I'd be more encouraged to work on it in the future.
# Currently focused on learning about Unity's physics system and trying to create a narwhal with similar movement to the real game, as well as getting some proper feeling collisions going.
